# openApi v3 Inheritance example

This repo serves as an example how you can inherit properties from a parent-schema (see Tool / Website Schema) for this. Also, you can see how split definitions are referenced. It's just more comfortable edit files than to edit a 5000+ LOC document, no ? :)

## License

This is just an example. The do-whatever-you-want-with-it-License applies.
